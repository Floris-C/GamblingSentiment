# README
This directory contains the scraper used for my OZP. It is very important to note that this code no longer works due to changes to the Twitter API. However it is provided for the sake of reproducibility in terms of what information to store. 

Code is executed through main.py which calls for scrapers in scraper.py. When required scraper.py uses queries.py to retrieve the queries or relevant keywords as defined in the thesis itself. 

The resulting data analysis can be reviewed as well as it is included as dataAnalysis.ipynb. Note that the file structure has been changed slightly before submission for the sake of readability. 


This project relies on https://github.com/twintproject/twint-zero and https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape. Updating to more recent versions of either to follow along with changes on Twitter may help reenable the functionality of this project. However as it is not maintained it may also simply break it.
